# FriendFinder2
## A Compatibility Based Friend-Finding Application

The user enters the quiz from the home page, completes the form to create a profile, and answers 10 compatibility questions using the drop-down menu (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree).  

When the quiz is submitted, the answers are compared to the answers of other profiles, and the profile of a 'best match' will be displayed in the modal.
